In today's mobile-first era, ensuring your website looks great on all screen sizes is crucial. 

On mobile devices, viewport sizes fluctuate due to dynamic toolbars like address bars and tab bars, causing elements to potentially overflow beyond the viewport.

In 2022, the CSS Working Group introduced dynamic viewport units (like dvw, dvh, dvi, dvb, dvmin, dvmax) to address this issue.

Implementing these units helps to optimize your website's performance across desktop and mobile platforms.
